# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Authentication - Best practice dictates we remove any form of access to the EC2 instance, thus making it inaccessible. Access could be allowed via AWS systems manager, with a proper instance profile role.
- Ingress Traffic - adjust SG settings and restrict ingress access. Web App instances should be in the private subnet.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- S3 buckets encryption (client & server side by default). Implement RBAC - instances must assume the correct role to access.
