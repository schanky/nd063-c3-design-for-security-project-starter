Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web App Servers are in a public subnet and the security group they are assigned to is overly permissive.
This increases the risk of attack.

# Poor practice 2
The S3 Buckets are deployed without server-side encryption, while also being publicly accessible.

# Further Remarks
- S3 policy is too permissive, allowing web servers to access any bucket.
- Web security group too open, allowing all traffic from any port for different methods of connection.
